Game of Thrones: Encyclopodrick

TIY Assignment - Make a simple Angular app

The purpose of this app is to display some of my skills with Angular, as well as get some practice with this framework. The main focus was getting the button functionality down while making API calls through Angular's $http service. The app lets the user select a Game of Thrones character via the buttons, and performs an API GET to pull and display some of that character's information from https://anapioficeandfire.com/.
